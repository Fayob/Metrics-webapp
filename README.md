# 📖 [Metric Webapp] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Metric Webapp]** is my React capstone  which is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) from the API that I worked with using of React and Redux.

I selected a Covid19 API that provides numeric data about all countries covid cases and then build the webapp around it. The webapp had two pages:
  - one page with a list of items that could be filtered by continent. This page is the homepage.
  - one page for each country's details
